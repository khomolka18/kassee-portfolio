        <h3>CONCEPTION</h3>
        <h2>A few highly motivated problem solvers.</h2>
        <p>Campfire started with a small team that strived for the evolution of our digital environment, and consistency throughout the enterprise. To gain support of stakeholders, we used the MyDish.com redesign as our pilot. It was a major project, and we knew that there would be significant backing through the full process, mainly testing hard to come by for smaller initiatives. From there, the Campfire team could use our data to grow throughout all parts of the enterprise.</p>

        <h3>GAINING MOMENTUM</h3>
        <h2>Open and welcoming is our expertise.</h2>
        <p>Campfire started as a small team but grew rapidly. The team wanted to facilitate collaboration to fully understand each area of the business and make this a design system that would be easily accepted into each brand. We held design workshops, internal interviews, sprints, and reviews to ensure each team was valued.</p>

        <h3>GOVERNING</h3>
        <h2>A fully functioning enterprise wide design system.</h2>
        <p>After research, design sprints, user testing, and everything else we were confident that this design system could be used across the enterprise. These applications would include DISH.com, Sling, all internal CX tools, and Wireless brands including Boost, Republic, and many others.</p>

        <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
        <h2>The transfer from Sketch to Figma.</h2>
        <p>Currently we are now in the rebuild stage, but it also is very much of a refresh. We are holding design sprints and workshops to push ourselves on the design and functionality from the ground up. We have landed on the atomic design approach, and are also taking this opportunity to build out processes for editing or adding components depending on each level they live in our DSM. Research and testing are a huge part of the process as we rebuild, especially at the atom level. It is an exciting project to learn how Sketch and Figma relate and differ. It has also been a great experience for our team, as there is a lot of training that goes along with transfering enterprise teams from one software to the other. Overall, its been an energizing, challenging, and rewarding project to manage.</p>

        <h2>Success for our customers and the company.</h2>
        <p>Very simply, the customers that used the onboarding app were more engaged than customers who did not. We observed engagement increases in connectivity, MyDISH account usage, OnDemand usage, hardware upgrades, and a longer customer lifespan. We totaled at a net enterprise impact of over 2 million dollars in just 5 months after launch date.</p>
